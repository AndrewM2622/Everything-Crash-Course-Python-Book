# Everything-Crash-Course-Python-Book
Hi, my name is Andrew. In these examples you will see myself, as I learn and grow in the Python programming language.
I will be taking you along with me step by step in all of the learning examples throughout my adventure through the book "Python Crash Course", by Eric Matthes.
you will see me as I go through the entire book one code example one after another.

I hope if you are new to programming you can really take something from this and apply it in your own programming adventure.
Good Luck, add whatever you would like to help with different methods of simplifing things down.
I look forward to seeing what everyone chooses to share if anyone at all.
Thank you!
